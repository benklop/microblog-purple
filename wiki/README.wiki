#general readme file for microblog-purple

= Introduction =

This is a plug-in for Pidgin or any other LibPurple base client like Adium or Finch. At least for now it works for Pidgin and Finch. I don't sure about Adium but hopefully someone will test it. Currently the plug-in works with Twitter only.

So what's the different between this and Twitter IM? The answer is this would be kind of my personal replacement for Twitter IM, since I spent sometimes waiting for the service to come back and don't want to wait anymore. Besides, having it as plug-in give me some liberty to customize it in many ways. Like modifying the message to link to hashtags or twitter user (thanks @chanwit), or the ability to add special command to itself (/refresh, /downtime, /etc....). I plan to have this in "Chat mode" instead of normal conversation windows for people who easily annoy with constant incoming messages.

= Building the code =
== Windows build ==
 # Follow [http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/BuildingWinPidgin Building on Windows HOWTO]
 # Download microblog-purple source code, untar and place it at pidgin-2.x.x/libpurple/protocols/microblog-purple
 # cd pidgin-2.x.x/libpurple/protocols/microblog-purple
 # make -f Makefile.mingw install
 # The built dll (libtwitter.dll) will be installed at pidgin-2.x.x/win32-install-dir/plugins. All images will be installed there too. Run new pidgin from win32-install-dir directory and it'll just works. You can copy the generated libtwitter.dll to your normal Pidgin installation directory. Don't forget to also copy all twitter*.png to correct path
 # If you want to build windows installer, type make -f Makefile.mingw pidgin-microblog.exe instead.
